1st ► VOTE pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
Observations: On deletion of Vote pod the current pod goes in terminating state while new vote pod is started. This is due to kind deployment which in turns using replica. Voting application continues without interruption and the result app preserves the votes. Below are commands.

3rd ► DB pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix"
Observation:  On deletion of db pod the current pod goes in terminating state while new db pod is started. The result app goes to initialised state with No Votes. The Vote data is lost as data stored in db pod is lost. The db pod is created with volume as emptyDir and this represents a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime. Below are commands

db-deployment.yaml
      volumes:
      - name: db-data
        emptyDir: {}
